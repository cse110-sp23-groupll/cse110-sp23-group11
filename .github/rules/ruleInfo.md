# Rules
A lot of the files are failing default/reccomended configurations so I made our own rules. I will give a brief description of the rules in this
document but I will give links to a rulesheet with better descriptions. 

## CSS rules https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules
1. color-no-invalid-hex : Invalid hex colors are not allowed. 
2. no-invalid-position-at-import-rule : Any @import rules must precede all other valid at-rules and style rules in a stylesheet (ignoring @charset and @layer), or else the @import rule is invalid.
3. string-no-newline: No newlines in strings. 
4. named-grid-areas-no-invalid" All grids must form a rectangle.
5. no-irregular-whitespace: No weird whitespaces.
