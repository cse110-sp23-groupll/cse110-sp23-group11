## Meeting Content
### Introductions
- Introduced ourselves as a refresher on everyone's names
- Discussed personal preferences on what we wanted to work on for the project
- Made sure to turn in the screenshot from our previous group bonding event where we played skribbl.io

### Deciding Team Name
- Decided on the name **Skateboard->RightFoot**
- Generally discussed future roles, though nothing is solidified yet
- Most people are open to different roles, no particularly strong preference towards front-end, back-end, etc.

### Planning Out Team Contract and Video
- Came up with basic terms, in regard to expectations for communication and completing work in a timely manner
- Decided to allow for a **24 hour window** for responding to messages, though with an imminent deadline we should respond within **8 or so hours**
- Over the weekends, responses within 24 hours are still expected, and if anyone were to have any issues with this, they should be communicated in advance
- Other expectations include: showing up to agreed meeting times (unless communicated otherwise beforehand or something sudden), being respectful and considerate of others' preferences, equal distribution of work
- For making the video, each of us are to create a 10 second video clip where a skateboard (imagined or physical) would come from our left into the frame, with a reaction of some sort involving our right foot (kicking it towards the right, being happy/angry/sad, etc.)
- A brief freeze frame with our name, major, and interests should pop up

### Team Meetings
- Will have **one recurring team meeting per week** at a set time, with other meetings being decided after class on Tuesday/Thursday to be flexible and account for the changing workload we all have each week
- When2Meet setup to decide this time, everyone should respond to it by Friday
- One concern discussed is how everyone will likely not be available at one set time: hoping to make accomodations/discuss this further at a future meeting

## Topics for Future Meetings
- Address concerns regarding meetings/availabilities
- Brainstorm and begin working on the 8-ball exploration project
- Begin coming up with ideas for our future project
- Come up with logo ideas and formalize branding
