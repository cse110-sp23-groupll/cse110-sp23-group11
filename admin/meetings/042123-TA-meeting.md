## What are the next steps for the project?
- Brainstorming: due next Wednesday
  - discuss ideas for the final project
  - the pitch document is due right after (the following Sunday)

## Weeks 6-10 will be for actual development

## Project: build a fortune teller
- 8ball can be one part of the application
- find some examples of fortune telling from around the world in different cultures
- **Bring up brainstorming in today's meeting**

## What we found from the 8ball project
- lots of spaghetti code
- generated more of a framework / infrastructure than usable code
