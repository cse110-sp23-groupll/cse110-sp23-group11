## Updates from Gagan
- The brainstorming documents are now **due Sunday**
- Small assignment: initial draft of pitch **due Friday**
  - Gagan can suggest stuff and we can work on it before the final
- Pitch is still **due Sunday**
- Each week, fill out peer review form
  - review how each teammate is doing
  - Gagan will send link when it is ready

## Notes on our idea
- strays away from the "fortune teller" aspect
- we _can_ do verbal pitch to him but we really only need to submit the documents
