### Connecting our idea to be more fortune telling
- Using Milanote created from last week's brainstorm meeting [here](https://app.milanote.com/1POZW41ikVTqbY?p=MdYuFEtys5t)
- Cartomancy, horoscopes, ouijia board, tarot cards
- Harish's idea: input emotions -> "signs point to ..., here's a recipe based on that"
- Vincent's idea: switch the output and input
- Hunter's idea: connect to Tarot cards, user picks cards and recipe is returned based on which cards are picked
- **Tarot Cards**: user thinks of a question (or enters one), cards are shuffled, then user picks cards
  - We can display the fortune and give recipe based on the cards + fortune (if not restricting input)
  - We design our own cards to be food related
  - Major Arcana of the deck has 22 cards (entire deck has 78)
  - Triangle of cards, position of each card corresponds to different aspects
- Restict input (if only asking about food-related fortunes): maybe at most 20 vague topics for the user to choose from
  - Also allow user to input the occasion that they are cooking for
- Another idea: user does not input a question at all
  - Our responses can just be really vague
  - More of a daily thing, where the user can check on how that day will be
  - Maybe use the time of day as a seed for randomization

### Starting pitch draft check-in assignment
- Our pitch deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tjJRSGqMmY4VZX_EYW-nEzxhO7Cw_zhsMn2SbuKtPj4/edit?usp=sharing)
- Working asynchronously for the most part
- Ask designers if they can do the system diagram part?
- Anything not fully fleshed out, work on it before final pitch (due Sunday)
- Try to finish by Friday afternoon to submit by Friday night!

## Topics for Future Meetings
- Work on implementation and design details of our website
