## Meeting Content
### Updates from Gagan
- Green light for the pitch!

### Divide groups to work on implementation
- Designers work on finalizing the wireframes
- 1 group working on recipes
  - Since the database part will probably be the most difficult, maybe 4 people to work on the recipe page
  - 1 frontend, 2 backend
- 1 group working on drawing cards page and homepage (since they are relatively simpler)
  - 2 frontend, 1 backend
- 1 group working on card interpretation page
  - 1 frontend, 1 backend
- Designers working closely with frontend as well as work on testing

### Clarification for backend
- Will start with local storage (JSON) and if we can figure out APIs for the recipes, we will use that instead
- How are we deciding what recipe to use? -> randomization
- Harish found a JSON with 1000+ recipes: [here](https://frosch.cosy.sbg.ac.at/datasets/json/recipes/-/blob/main/recipes.json)

### Who is in each group
