# Attendance
- Everyone except Thanh (she sent her updates earlier)

# High points
- Super linter!!!
- Figma is nice to use for design, hotpot useful for generating our assets
- We have a structure set up for our sprints now
- Team communication throughout the week is good

# Try to work on
- Don't push things to main (especially for small changes), add branches
  - however we currently have a few unnecessary branches
- Cut kind of on the CI/CD due date
  - **positive note:** we were able to finish and we communicated well leading up to submission

# Artifacts
- Each group has screen recordings or images / gifs of what they've made so far
- Found in main branch of repo
