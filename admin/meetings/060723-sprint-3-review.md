# Homepage / Drawing Cards
- Alex: worked on putting the card selection result into JSON to be used in interpretation part
  - debugged three card selection and shuffling cards, moved source files
  - question: how should we keep in local storage? - separate past/present/future ?

# Interpretation
- Harish: finished backend, better integrated with local storage
  - buttons on interp work; json for card data finished (includes upside down)
  - currently generates interpretations based on the positive/negative values
  - can help with other parts if needed
- Jennifer: added descriptions and interpretations for each card
- Todo: make general interps, update css for the cards, integrate cards with card selection page

# Recipe
- Seonghun: finished writing test code for recipe generator and merged to main
  - fixed some code for generator and css for interpretation page

# Design -> Testing
- From Hunter:
  - Continued working on the E2E tests I am pretty comfortable creating puppeteer tests to navigate the website now
  - figured out a problem with the shuffle.js file that was breaking the puppeteer from working
  - discovered a bug in the shuffle button where the count would not reset which was able to be fixed
  - assisted with the JSON interpretations file

# CI/CD Pipeline
- Vincent: code coverage done!
- Sophia: JSDocs
  - want to change formatting of documentation
  - can help with other parts if needed
