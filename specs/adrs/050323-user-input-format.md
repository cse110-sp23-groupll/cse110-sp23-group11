# No user input for now
## Context and Problem Statement
* what kind of user input we want?

## Considered Options

* limited imput using drop down menu and button
* no input and give vague response (no input meaning nothing beyond simply selecting cards and viewing the result)
* text box, allow any input.

## Decision Outcome
* choose option:"no user input", because this is the easiest option for us at this stage, if we want to improve our project, we can then switch to limited input.
