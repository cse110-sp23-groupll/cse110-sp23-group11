# design of the back of each card
## Context and Problem Statement
* Choosing between designs for the final card design

## Considered Options
* Blue
> ![Blue Back](source/assets/FinishedTarotCards/BacksideofTarotCard2.png)
* Brown
> ![Brown Back](source/assets/FinishedTarotCards/TarotCardBack.png)
* both options are found in `source/assets/`

## Decision Outcome
* Brown (by vote of all team members), so our final card design will have this brown back and one of the Major Arcana designs in the front. Here's an example with the front as the "Judgement" card.
