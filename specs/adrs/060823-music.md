# Music in background
## Context and Problem Statement
* Should we have music playing in the background?
* Would the user toggle it on/off?
* What music?

## Considered Options
* Autoplay the music and loop continuously
* Have a button to toggle
### Sound options
* [Cooking Mama music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uai3-czGpts) for the background
* [Animal Crossing music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVAOFCqdyXM&list=PLZq7Jn-XiIlskI0PI31tG_nSt8qPDjgsq) for the background
* [No copyright music](https://maou.audio/category/bgm/) for the background
* [Breath of the Wild sound effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fi85dxZZFE) for when the user is done selecting cards

## Decision Outcome
* Have a button to toggle on/off
* The requirements to autoplay music is different from browser to browser, so making a toggle button is the best way to overcome this issue
