# styles/cardPage.css

### done by Sophia Yu

1. Issue with padding for cards: page layout gets messed up when the window is not in full size (specifically, the cards are shifted to the right and some are off the screen)
2. add comments to categorize the styles, so we know which sections are related
3. maybe it's a good idea to add comments for each style
