# Code Review for interp.css
* Could use a few more comments to explain what exactly is being modified (i.e., why are certain attributes being added/their overall effect after being selected) just to make things clearer
* Other than that, the code itself looks fine! No particular issues with the CSS, seems fairly straightforward and well-organized code
