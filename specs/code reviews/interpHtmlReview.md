1. `div class="red"` - is there a better name for this one? I think the majority of the page is red, so unclear about what section this is describing
2. `div class="container"` - same as above, not very descriptive
3. `card now`, `card future`, `card past` - are these out of order? it seems like left is present, middle is future, and right is past
4. `card past: card back`: is "The Hermit" but the other ones are "Name of Card"
